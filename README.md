# TicTacToe
This is my first project where I will be working on a simple game of tic tac toe.

Issues I faced:
- One of the main issues that I faced developing this game is an issue I believe is a common issue among student. As there are significant differences between solving issues that have already been provided to us by the course administrators rather than building a whole system from nothing.
- Unfamiliar with libraries that I could access to develop the game, such the libraries that I accessed in the game.

How I overcame these hurdles:
- The purpose of this project was to create a simple project to put myself outside of my comfort zone and push myself beyond what is typically taught in university. I spend a significant portion of my time researching libraries that would match my needs and would allow me to create an interactive game with an interface and buttons. I already had the knowledge of how to code the actual implementation of the game which gave me a lot of self confidence but just spent a majority of my time familiarising myself with the aws library and how to create buttons.

Things that I can improve:
- I am happy with the result of my game, however, I do believe that the method that I have implemented to check for winners is quite repetitive and can be improved.
- As this is my first project, I chose a very simple task which to me did not require blackbox testing, however, this is not the best practice for an individual aspiring to be a software engineer. It is always important to understand why we want to use both blackbox and white box testing, and why we should always be implementing these forms of testing. So going forward I do believe for every other project I want to ensure that I am using the best practices of a software engineer.
